            "text": "<p>North Carolina native Emmy Ellison was raised in a home that cultivated her love of design and environmental aesthetics since childhood. Benefiting from a lifetime of world travel and being surrounded by artists, academics, and leaders in business, Emmy's unique perspective and skill set led her to a degree in production design. Becoming a mother refocused her purpose in life towards home and the beauty within it. After embarking on a journey of self-discovery to Morocco, she was impacted irrevocably by the complexity and depth of Moroccan culture, traditions, and design.<\/p><p>Thus the de Maroc Collection was born, a pure passion project that has become one of the world’s most foremost collections of its kind. Emmy is excited to share her collection with you. <\/p>",
